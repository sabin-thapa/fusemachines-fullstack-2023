#### HTML Basics 
Resource: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/The_head_metadata_in_HTML

- Metadata: the <meta> element
Metadata is data that describes data, and HTML has an "official" way of adding metadata to a document â€” the <meta> element.
For example, we can specify the document's character encoding as:

      ` <meta charset = 'utf-8' /> `

This element specifies the document's character encoding -- the character set that the document is permitted to use. utf-8 is a universal character set that includes pretty much any character from any human language. So, our web page will be able to handle displaying any language. 

If you set your character encoding to ISO-8859-1, for example (the character set for the Latin alphabet), your page rendering may appear all messed up:

Many <meta> elements include name and content attributes:
**name** specifies the type of meta element it is; what type of information it contains.
**content** specifies the actual meta content.

### Layout

- `nav` contains the main navigation functionality for the page. Secondary links, etc., would not go in the navigation.
- `main` is for content unique to this page. Use <main> only once per page, and put it directly inside <body>. Ideally this shouldn't be nested within other elements.
      
- `article` encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page (e.g., a single blog post). 
- `section` is similar to `article`, but it is more for grouping together a single part of the page that constitutes one single piece of functionality 
- `aside` contains content that is not directly related to the main content but can provide additional information indirectly related to it (glossary entries, author biography, related links, etc.).
- `header` represents a group of introductory content. If it is a child of `body` it defines the global header of a webpage, but if it's a child of an - `article` or `section` it defines a specific header for that section (try not to confuse this with titles and headings).
- `footer` represents a group of end content for a page.

      
# Nodejs
Node.js is a runtime for built on top of Chrome's V8. It allows you to develop apps in JavaScript outside of the browser. It's single threaded non blocking and asynchronous. This is acheived by the use of an event loop at the core of Node.js.

### Executing Node
- **Node REPL(Read-Eval-Print Loop)** <br />
  It is a command-line interface that allows you to execute JavaScript code and interact with it in real-time.
  
     ` To launch the Node REPL, you can open your terminal or command prompt and type node followed by the Enter key. You will then see the Node REPL  prompt `(>)`, indicating that you can start entering JavaScript code. `
 
- **Script file:** <br /> You can create a JavaScript file with the .js extension and write your Node.js code in it. You can then execute the script file by running the node command followed by the file name. For example, `node index.js`.

- **Command line arguments:** <br /> You can pass command line arguments to a Node.js script by running the node command followed by the file name and the arguments. For example, `node index.js arg1 arg2`.

- **Using a package.json script:** <br />If you have a Node.js project with a package.json file, you can define scripts that can be executed with the npm run command. For example, if you have a script called start defined in your package.json file, you can run it by running the command `npm run start`.
